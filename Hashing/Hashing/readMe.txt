The poems generated by the computer would make more sense if we could tell it to 
follow the rules of grammar. Along those lines, being able to tell the difference 
between a word, a phrase, and a sentence would greatly improve it's legibility. It 
would also be nice if the program could tell when it has repeated a phrase. That 
would help prevent the situations where it gets stuck saying the same line over and 
over again. 

The poems that were made off of a greater range in words and phrases (such as 
seuss.txt and poe.txt) were able to have more advanced poems. This is probably 
because there were more words in each first word's vector allowing for more 
opportunities for the poem to go a different direction.
